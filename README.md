# Interim Report

## TODO:
- [ ] `git grep REVISIT`
- [x] Contact Kan Shi for his testbench
- [x] Work done to date
- [x] Structure shift, break up Chapter III, highlight TB comparison early
- [x] Acronym check
- [x] Explain buffer in interface in Clock domain section
- [ ] Find motivation for high radix on FPGA
- [x] Consider buffering test to on-chip memory


## Notes:
- ~free license has limitations, slower, less fpga support etc.~
- ~imperial has academic license~
- ~the Zed board -> similar capabilities~
- another board with better power management
- ~with HPS, self-contained. more accessible later on. less setup. 
  complete product.~
- maybe turning tax in serial vs parallel operators?
- Intel at Arith gave ASIC with high radix paper
