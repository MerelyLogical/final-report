\section{Conclusion}
In this report, I have provided motivation for the project through background
research.
This motivation is then formulated into a organised list of deliverables.
With the deliverables set, the tools required to build them are chosen with
justification.
Next, an initial design sketch is proposed to achieve the specifications.
With this, the tasks were broken into smaller piece, which were laid onto
a timeline.
The tasks which were already complete, were documented; and the tasks in the
future, were planned with engineering uncertainties in mind.
Examining the expectations of the project together with the plan of
implementation, gave rise to an evaluation plan, which will serve as targets
during the engineering process, and yardsticks when the project completes.
An overview of the non-technical concerns was also provided at the end.

While this report seeks to cover and plan for every aspect of the project, it
cannot be perfect.
There will always be unexpected changes, which will be reflected in the final
report.

I thus look forward to working on this project in the next 5 months.
