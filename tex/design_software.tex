\section{Code Structure}
The test script runs on the HPS of SoC board, providing an interface for the user to run their tests on the FPGA.
It is able to control the frequency of the FPGA and configure the testbench according to the need of the user.
It should also read from the scoreboard to results to the user.

\section{Software Configuration}
In order to improve usability, the user interface of the software should not include direct manipulation of the code.
While this is not an excuse for messy and unreadable code, having a separate configuration file is much more user friendly.
This configuration file will use a simple syntax to make all the options available to edit.
The software can then parse these and run accordingly.
