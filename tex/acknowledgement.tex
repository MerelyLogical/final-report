  I would like to express my gratitude to my supervisor, Dr. James Davis, for his continuous support at every stage of the project.
  As someone that started with limited experiences in FPGAs, he skilfully guided me through the engineering process with his impressive technical knowledge and great patience.
  In report writing, he also provided extremely detailed and timely feedback that I could never thank enough for.
