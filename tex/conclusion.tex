\chapter{Conclusion}

In this project, we have proposed an extensible framework for at-speed testing of arithmetic hardware.
Using the proposed architecture, we then implemented a testbench to demonstrate its utility and customisability.
The modular implementation was verified separately and together with simulations and test runs on FPGA, following which we have estimated the performance of the complete testbench with software tools and hardware benchmarks.
These tests showed that the testbench is stable at 400MHz, and thus 4 orders of magnitude faster than a similar test in software simulation.
To study its user-friendliness, we have also conducted an out-of-the-box test.
A volunteer with no previous knowledge of the project successfully configured the packaged product and obtained desired results without major issues within 2 hours, showing that the testbench can indeed be helpful to a wide range of users.
