    manual <a|b> <hex>  & Give input in manual mode. \\
    bitset <a|b> <hex>  & Force bits to be 1 in auto mode. \\
    bitclr <a|b> <hex>  & Force bits to be 0 in auto mode. \\
    run <time>         & Runs the test for specified duration in ms. Prints the results at the end of the test. \\

Notes:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Arguments in angle brackets are required. Arguments in square brackets are optional. Vertical bars separate all possible options.
  \item Frequency configuration is done by a PLL which has limited granularities. As such the actual frequency may differ from the desired frequency.
  \item Argument \texttt{<a|b>} is used to select which input this command will apply to.
  \item \texttt{<hex>} needs to be in the format \texttt{\textasciicircum(0x)?[0-9a-fA-F]\{1,8\}\$}. In words, it takes 1 to 8 digits of case-insensitive hexadecimal digits. No other characters including space or underscore is allowed, base prefixe \texttt{0x} is unnecessary but allowed.
  \item Under the current hardware environment, a safe range for \texttt{<speed>} in MHz is from 50 to 400.
\end{itemize}
