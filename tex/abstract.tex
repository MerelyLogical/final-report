% An Extensible Framework for At-speed Evaluation of Arithmetic Hardware

\begin{abstract}
In this project, we aim to provide an customisable evaluation framework for arithmetic hardware.
Initially, the project is conceived to perform at-speed testing of a set of newly designed high-radix online arithmetic units.
The key benefits of this exotic configuration are its high throughput and ability to fail gracefully.
As such, the testbench is designed to have a high maximum bandwidth and a method of monitoring the precision of the errors.
However, we soon realised that in general, researchers would build their own ad-hoc testbench on FPGAs when experimenting with a new operator design.
To improve the efficiency of their research and developments, we propose a flexible evaluation system for arithmetic units with this project.
The framework includes both the testing software and the hardware architecture to minimise work for the user.
Using a Cyclone V SoC development board, the system is implemented to demonstrate that it is indeed easy to setup and use, and can be modified to accommodate a variety of testing situations.
