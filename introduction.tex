\section{Introduction}
% The Interim report should normally be between 10 and 30 pages long. Remember
% that it must be a project planning document for the remainder of your project
% work, as well as being an early write-up of your background material. Using
% Interim Report material, without explicit reference, in your Final Report is
% allowed, and even encouraged. The Interim Report is often a first draft of the
% background section of the Final Report. Self-plagiarism, in this case, is not an
% issue. It is expected that you will reuse Interim Report material without
% explicit reference.
% REVISIT: this is directly from James's project discription
With the right number representation system, it is possible to perform
arithmetic operations MSD-first.
Consequently, these on-line arithmetic operators are attractive
for hardware implementation in both serial and parallel forms.
When computing digits serially, they can be chained such that subsequent
operations begin before the preceding ones complete.
Parallel implementations tend to be most sensitive to failure in their LSD,
making them more friendly to overclocking than their LSD-first counterparts,
for which the opposite is true.

In the past, on-line operators have typically been implemented in binary.
Along with its sister project,
This project will explore high radix on-line operators,
investigating their suitability for FPGA implementation and examining the
resultant trade-offs between performance, area and power.
